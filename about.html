                    <h1>Cats Are Kids</h1>
                        <p>
                            I think some people are in need of an attitude adjustmentconcerning our companion animals, 
                            particularly cats and dogs. Scientificstudies have shown that these animals function on the 
                            intellectual andemotional level of a 3 year-old child, yet people do things to them thatthey 
                            would never consider doing to their small children. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, good parents would never:
                            Let their child wander the streets unattended with no identification.
                            Leave their child alone in the backyard, day and night. 
                            Abandon their child in a strange neighborhood, hoping that some kind personwould take the child in and care for it.
                            Allow their child to promiscuously have sex with whomever passes by andbecome pregnant.
                            Fail to teach their child proper manners.
                            Neglect to provide their child proper medical care.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet many people think it's perfectly fine to do all of these things to 
                            their pet dogs and cats. If these creatures are on the same emotional and intellectual 
                            level of a 3 year-old human child, then adopting a pet isa much more serious step than 
                            people realize. You are actually becomingthe pet's parent and the pet is not something 
                            to be tossed aside like astuffed toy if the family tires of the responsibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our pets want and deserve to be a part of our family circles. And for thosewho feel that 
                            the world cannot exist without Fifi or Tom's offspring, considerthis: For every person born, 
                            15 dogs and 45 cats are also born. So there is no danger we will be in short supply if they 
                            spay or neuter their pet. Spaying or neutering is your duty and obligation and there are many 
                            low-costclinics to assist you. Give the gift of life, adopt a homeless cat or dogand learn and 
                            practice responsible pet ownership. You will get so muchmore than you give.

                    <p>
                        I saw a dead cat in the road today. Was he yours? My heart cried. You thought he needed his freedom, you 
                        think that cats need to roam. You thought he would never leave your yard or jump the fence.You didn't think 
                        about that teasing bird or squirrel he just had to chase. How long will it be until you know he will never be coming home? 
                        Will youtry to find him or just assume he found a new home? Will you even grieve? I grieved for him. 
                        You may never know that he lay there bloody and stillwith all his life violently wrenched from him in an instant. 
                        You say you cared; then why was he outdoors and unprotected? He gave you his all. Now he has died for you. 
                        I saw a dead cat in the road today. Was he YOURS?
