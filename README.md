PetPride.org
Project 1

For our first project we decided to tackle an incredibly difficult task, redesigning and updating a website we can only assume was created the last time the San Diego Super Chargers made it to the superbowl.  Petpride.Org was an outdated mess, all pages were built using outdated HTML code. We updated each of the pages to give our client a sample of what a modernized website can do for her.  We revamped the "home", "about us", "programs", "donations", and "mailing list' pages to look like a current day charity website.  

In the Home page we added a carousel to give the viewer an explanation of different areas of the site and offer a quick blurb about what the viewer will find when the land on the page.

The About us page provides us with another carousel, the address of the "No-kill" shelter, phone number and their hours of operation.  We were also able to provide directions via the google-maps-directions API. 

IN the programs page we provided the viewer with information regarding the different ways people can contribute to the organization.

the Donations page provides a space for the view of the webpage to donate directly to the charity in addition to providing a link-button to amazon's smile program where the viewer can choose to contribute to the non-profit for by selection it as a charity.

The mailing list page was also updated using a more modern email api (i.e. MailChimp).  This will allow for viewers to sign up for a mailing list as well as allow the client to better track their "membership".
